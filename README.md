# Code Outsourcing via Blockchain

This project introduces an automated payment process to facilitate code development outsourcing. This is achieved by integrating Github with the Ethereum blockchain. The solution consists of three main components. A smart contract responsible for paying the developer and delivering a fixed code package, Git as the version control system to manage code and test artifacts, and a test infrastructure implemented via Jenkins that orchestrates the process of code validation, contract compilation, deployment and invocation.
